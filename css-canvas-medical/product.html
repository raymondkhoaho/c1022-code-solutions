        <h1>It's the foundation for patient-centered primary care.</h1>
        <p>Canvas creates a shared understanding of patient care across clinicians,
          and patients themselves — making you more productive, less stressed,
          and adding just a bit more joy into your practice of medicine.

        <h2>It puts care at your command</h2>
        <p>You don't have to click a dozen times to order a flu shot or bounce
          around five windows to discover the last blood count. Canvas pulls
          everything you need directly into your note, so you never have to leave
          it. And because canvas learns from every interaction, it gets smarter
          with every patient you see.

        <p><em>&ldquo;Canvas works three times as fast, improves performance dramatically
          on key quality metrics, and is incredibly easy to use. The right information
          is presented in the right way at the right time, and the product leverages
          technology to actually improve the quality of care I provide.&rdquo;</em>

          Easily reach out to any subgroup of your population with proactive
          interventions, and take comfort knowing you're a step ahead.

          those are tremendously important questions. But I just couldn't get an

        <h2>It automates performance improvement</h2>
        <p>Clinical quality and revenue cycle reports can help you understand
          performance, but they aren't enough to improve quality and increase
          revenue day after day. Canvas automates quality protocols and charge
          capture so clinicians can focus on more complex work only they can do.

        <p><em>&ldquo;With MIPS a reality and fee-for-service billing rules as complex
          as ever, to be honest I didn't know how we were going to keep up. We're
          a small practice and we don't have a big quality team or a group of
          coders to catch everything. The automation in Canvas has completely
          eliminated my concerns around quality and revenue performance.&rdquo;</em>
